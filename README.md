# Tetris-Clone---Console-Version
This project is a simple console-based version of the classic Tetris game, implemented in Python. The game runs in the terminal and allows players to control Tetromino pieces as they fall, aiming to complete and clear lines on a 10x20 grid.

# Features

  Classic Tetromino Shapes: The game includes all seven classic Tetromino shapes (I, J, L, O, S, T, Z).
    

# Basic Controls:
  
  W: Rotate the Tetromino.
        
  A: Move the Tetromino left.
        
  S: Move the Tetromino down.
        
  D: Move the Tetromino right.
  
  Q: Quit the game.
    
  Line Clearing: Complete lines are automatically cleared from the board.
    
  Game Over Detection: The game ends when a new Tetromino collides with blocks already on the board.

# How to Play

  Start the Game: Run the Python script in a terminal to start playing.
    
  Control the Tetrominoes: Use the W, A, S, and D keys to rotate and move the pieces.
    
  Clear Lines: Try to fill complete horizontal lines with blocks to clear them.
  
  Game Over: The game ends if a Tetromino cannot be placed on the board due to existing blocks.

# Warning

  Dizziness: The constant movement of Tetrominoes in this game may cause dizziness or discomfort in some players. If you experience this, please do not use.

# Dependencies

  Python 3.x
  
  msvcrt (Windows only, used for handling keyboard input)
  
  os and time (standard Python libraries)


# Planned Updates

  Score Tracking: Implement a scoring system based on the number of lines cleared and the speed of play.
  
  Levels: Introduce levels that increase the game's speed as the player progresses.
  
  Enhanced Graphics: Add color to the Tetrominoes and improve the visual presentation within the console.
    
  Save/Load Game: Implement save and load functionality to allow players to pause and resume their game.
  
  Sound Effects: Add basic sound effects for actions like line clearing and game over.
